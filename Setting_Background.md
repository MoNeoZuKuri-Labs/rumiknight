# Mythological/Historical Background
## The Original Tribe
All of society used to be one group, a single tribe of beings who ended up on a pocket world isolated from the rest of reality. 
- On this world of their own volition or abandoned/exiled there? Their choice or against their wishes?

The group of beings left on this world were all babies/seeds. They were the next generation of a race of beings doomed to become extinct, dying off due to inner conflict and environmental disaster. They were transported on the **Silver River** ship.
